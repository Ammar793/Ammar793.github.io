            <p>
               While completing my undergrad in Electrical Engineering at McGill University I have gotten the chance to get some real work experience through various internships.
            </p>

                    <h4><i>May-Aug 2016</i></span></h4>
                    <p>
                     As part of the AISEC Global Entrepreneurship program I travelled to Athens, Greece to work at this great local  startup. Innoetics consists of a team of speech experts and engineers and the company focuses on creating state-of-the-art synthetic voices with high performance in accuracy, intelligibility, expressivity and naturalness.
                     <br />    <br />
                     My role there was of a software developer intern and I helped extend their text-to-speech platform for the languages Urdu and Arabic. This included defining rules and writing code in C++ for normalization, grapheme to phoneme conversion and unit selection.
                    <br /><br />
                    I also built a web application for them that allowed users to enter text and then be able to modify that text by dividing it into layers and adding Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) markers to it.

                    <p>
                     Autodesk is the world leader in design software and builds the top design softwares for many industries including architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment industries.
                    <br /><br />
                     Autodesk's Media and Entertainment division is located in it's Montreal office where I worked in the Games team on Autodesk's game engine Stingray.
                        <br /><br />
                    My role there was of a Test and Build Automation intern and I learnt a lot about different software validation methods including regression testing, integration testing, validation testing and unit testing. I was also responsible for maintaining and improving the continuous integration pipeline to create source code deliveries in an environment of globally distributed design and development.
					<br><br>
					My biggest project there involved implementing image comparison tests to test for rendering discrepancies while deployment of the game engine on multiple platforms including PS4, XBOX One, Android and PC. Other tasks included retrieving and storing output logs and dump files from multiple platforms and configuring the configuration management software Saltstack to make the setup of remote machines more stable and reliable

                    <h4><i>Jan- Aug 2015</i></span></h4>
                    <p>
                      Shell Canada is the subsidiary of the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell and is one of Canada's largest integrated oil companies. I worked at the Shell Scotford plant which is one of North America’s largest, most modern and most efficient petrochemical facilities.
                        <br /><br />
                        My position there was of a Process Automation Controls and Optimization (PACO) intern. During my eight months there I worked with people from many different backgrounds and skill levels and learnt a great deal about working in a company as huge and spread out as Shell.
                        <br /> <br /> My biggest project there was to  install a wireless communication / fire and gas detection system in a remote building. There were many different stakeholders involved in this project so it required a great deal of coordination with team members, vendors and other people from other disciplines. The project also required defining and implementing the instrumentation/electrical scope and PLC/radio/DCS configuration for the installation of the radio system and the optical beam smoke detectors in the building. I presented my solution to the various stakeholders at the end of the internship and succeeded in getting funding approval.
						<br><br>
						Apart from this I had many other tasks including assisting team members in commissioning and tuning of base-layer control loops for PID controllers, writing scripts in Experion HMIWEB for DCS graphics in the Honeywell system and conducting walk downs after project completion to ensure that work was completed as per the scope and standards of the company.
