            <p>Humans and Machines have been linked for a long time now and we have used computers, telephones, calculators, fridges, cars and countless other machines for decades as tools that help us complete certain tasks.</p>

            <p>This is changing however and the machines are changing, and with that is coming a paradigm shift in how we perceive machines. They are no longer single purpose dumb machines. They can now see, hear, move, learn, adapt. You can control them from miles away and you can be completely immersed in them. They can also update in real time, The Tesla added ….</p>

            <p>Terms like User Interface change to User Experience, because it really is an experience. For the past year I have been waking up to Samsung’s Bixby telling me what the weather is and I have been asking her questions about everything.</p>

            <p>But the funniest thing is that the change we see is not only in the machines, we are ourselves changing in order to adapt to the machines that we have built ourselves. Our brains have adapted from memorizing things, to being able to search for things. If we can find answers to any question in a matter of seconds, why take the trouble to memorize it? This was perhaps best presented in a hilarious event where I forgot a friend at a gas station on a road trip from Toronto to Montreal, he remembered no phone numbers and all his accounts had multi-factor authentication on it so he could not log in to a single app to contact me (I believe he did try to email me though). I, believing that he was asleep in the back seat, drove on for 1.5 hours before the passenger to my side woke up and asked ‘Ammar… Umm, where’s Fez?’.</p>

            <p>We are more than ever reliant on the machines around us, and our relationship with them is becoming more and more on an equal footing and like any relationship communication is key and so we need to improve our interaction with them.</p>

            <p>So the change is happening and in order to take advantage of the improvement in recent years in computing power, clever algorithms, cloud computers giving you easy access to high speed computers and servers, we need to build smarter ways to interact with computers and hence the term Human – Computer Interaction was born. Though nascent in many ways, it is growing fast.</p>

            <p>So with this blog I keep an eye out on what’s happening and keep all of you updated with projects that help me. I also take you through some of the projects I have built that have helped humans interact with computers.</p>

            <p>Tldr: If you’re interested in technology, keep an eye out for my blogs as I will keep you updated on what’s happening and what I’m doing with it all.</p>


            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
